# High Dimension Analysis Assignment 2020
My assignment in course High Dimension Analysis of VNUHCM-University of Sciences, 2019-2020

## Requirement

### Lab0

Apply the PCA algorithm to compute K eigenfaces dataset: http://cam-orl.co.uk/facedatabase.html
- (a) Consider the case, K = 2, 5, 10, 15, 20. Plot the eigenfaces for each case.
- (b) Visualize your image to be restored in case the selected K value ensures between 99% variance.

### Lab1

Using the room temperature dataset in file room-temperature.csv:
- a) Plot a time series plot for each type of temperature data: FrontLeft, FrontRight, BackLeft and BackRight.
- b) Implement the PCA algorithm to the whole data set.
- c) After observing these time series plot in a), how many latent variables should we use for the PCA algorithm to keep the most meaningful information? Apply the PCA for the temperature data by your chosen number of latent variables.

### Lab2

Apply Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithm on the Iris flower dataset. Make a comparison between LDA and PCA projected samples.

### Lab3

Import the CSV file 'College.csv' and do the following analytics:
- a) Find all private schools with a graduation rate of higher than 90%.
- b) Using all attributes from the initial dataset except for the Private attribute, do the K-mean clustering method with two clusters. After this step, we will split the original data into two groups (private or not).
- c) Illustrate the predicted cluster and Private attribute (ground truth) to compare them. Please write your comment about the results.

### Lab4

Applying the t-SNE on Fashion-MNIST dataset
